START

Step 1) Give the following definition of the 4-light, 5-state system's sequence:
	
	State 1 : Solid Green for 15 seconds with an Advanced Left Green Arrow.
	
	State 2 : Is Solid Green for 5 seconds with an Advanced Left Amber Arrow.
	
	State 3 : For 45 seconds, Solid Green + Advanced Left Arrow (off).
	
	State 4 : For 45 seconds, Solid Green + Advanced Left Arrow (on).
	
	State 5 : Solid Amber for 10 seconds.
	
	State 6 : Solid Red for an 75 seconds  of time.

Step 2) Set Current light to Red and the duration of the red light will be 75 seconds.

Step 3)To check for the vehicles at the intersection using the sensors,
	   If there will be any vehicle then,
			The signal light will turn on green (For 50 seconds) from red and Walking signal will also activate.

Step 4) Walk Request
	Where there is an interruption of walk request:
		1. Red Light will appear again after the total time of 75 seconds.
		2. If a predestrian pressed the walk button then the 75 seconds timer will deduce to 10 seconds.

Step 5) If an interrupt signal is received, pause the current traffic light sequence and give priority to the emergency vehicle. Is there a interrupt?
	a. Yes
		1. Its a 4 way stop to reset the traffic lights.
		2. Inspect the system for any interruptions. If an interrupt is found, respond appropriately.

		5. In the event that the light is currently "red," see if there are five or more vehicles parked at the junction. If so, cut the time spent waiting at the red-light condition to 10 seconds.

Step 6) Display Solid Green with an Advanced Left Green Arrow for 15 seconds.

Step 7) If an interrupt signal is received, Execute Step 5.

Step 8) Is Solid Green for 5 seconds with an Advanced Left Amber Arrow.

Step 9) If an interrupt signal is received, Execute Step 5.

Step 10) For 45 seconds, Solid Green + Advanced Left Arrow (off).

Step 11) If an interrupt signal is received, Execute Step 5.

Step 12) For 45 seconds, Solid Green + Advanced Left Arrow (on).

Step 13) If an interrupt signal is received, Execute Step 5.

Step 14) Solid Amber for 10k seconds.

Step 15) If an interrupt signal is received, Execute Step 5.

Step 16) Go to Step 2 or set Current light to Red and the duration of the red light will be 75 seconds.
