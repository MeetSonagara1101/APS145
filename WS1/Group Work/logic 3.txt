#Logic 3

Step 1  - Set each player's total throw attempts to four.

Step 2  - Set up counters for successful basket and tie attempts.

Step 3  - Start a loop that will run until a winner is determined.

Step 4  - Player 1 will make all 4 throw attempts. And after that Player 2 will make all 4 throw attempts.

Step 5  - Determine the winner or if the game is tied by comparing the number of successful baskets made by each player.

Step 6  - If one player has more successful baskets than the other, than that player is winner.

Step 7  - If the number of successful baskets is equal, then the game is tied, and the loop continues.

Step 8  - If the game is tied, then increment the counter for the number of ties.

Step 9  - Alternate who plays first in the next game in case of ties. If Player 1 played first in the current game, then Player 2 will play first in the next game, and vice versa.

Step 10 - Repeat the loop to start a new game until a winner is determined.
